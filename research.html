<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>In order to select reliable tracks from the limited measurement cycles, the track initiation has been studied, which affects all subsequent stages of target tracking. Numerous false target tracks were produced by traditional logic algorithms, and the Hough transform method was sensitive to noise. Based on adaptive gates and fuzzy Hough transform, a track initiation algorithm is proposed in this paper, which combines the advantages of the two types of methods to reduce the amount of false alarm, and completes the high-quality track initiation. Firstly, an adaptive gate is designed to filter the detection clutter. And then the fuzzy theory is used to obtain the accumulated matrix in the Hough transform process. Finally, the tracks are determined by the threshold method, and the track initiation is completed. The proposed method can reduce the false track occupancy rate, and complete higher quality track initiation in short detection cycles in simulation experiments. It is more suitable for multi-target track initiation under the surroundings of intensive clutter.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Multiple object tracking (MOT) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos has attracted attention. Because of the observation perspectives of UAV, the object scale changes dramatically and is relatively small. Besides, most MOT algorithms in UAV videos cannot achieve real-time due to the tracking-by-detection paradigm. We propose a feature-aligned attention network (FAANet). It mainly consists of a channel and spatial attention module and a feature-aligned aggregation module. We also improve the real-time performance using the joint-detection-embedding paradigm and structural re-parameterization technique. We validate the effectiveness with extensive experiments on UAV detection and tracking benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art 44.0 MOTA, 64.6 IDF1 with 38.24 frames per second running speed on a single 1080Ti graphics processing unit.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>A space-based heterogeneous sensor deployment optimization method for multi-agent cooperative detection tasks is proposed to solve the problem of limited deployment of space-based platforms and incomplete sensing information of target areas in multi-agent cooperative detection in the sea surface area. First, a heterogeneous sensor detection model is established by considering the complex detection environment and combining the data characteristics of the sensors. Then, the detection probability of the sensors to the target is adopted as the deployment performance index. Finally, considering the regional deployment requirements, the optimal deployment model of sensor resources is constructed. The sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is used to solve the optimal deployment problem. The simulation results show that the proposed optimization method can effectively improve the overall information perception capability of the mission area under the constraints of ensuring the coverage perception of key areas in multi-agent collaborative detection and restricted sensor deployment locations. Compared with the classical particle swarm search algorithm, SSA has better convergence and a shorter search time for solving the problem. The research can provide technical support for resource allocation in multi-agent sensor management.</p>
