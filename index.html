Welcome! My name is Liu Zeng and I study for the masterâ€™s degree in the <a href="https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/">School of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>, <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>(SJTU). I received the bachelor degree from <a href="https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/">Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>(NUAA), Nanjing, China. 
<br><br>
My major research topics are multi-target track initiation, multi-target tracking and signal processing. My <a href="https://zengliuivy.github.io/research">research</a> has appeared in academic journals including <i>Signal, Image and Video Processing</i>, the <i>Chinese Optics Letters</i>, and the <i>Aerospace Systems</i>. 
<br><br>
I have some experience in <a href="https://zengliuivy.github.io/tutorials">Research Projects</a> at the image fusion group of advanced avionics and intelligent information laboratory. It is mainly related to track initiation, tracking and multi-sensor signal processing. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and deep learning.
