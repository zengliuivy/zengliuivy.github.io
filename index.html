Welcome! My name is Liu Zeng and I  study for the masterâ€™s degree in the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. And I received the bachelor degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China. 
<br><br>
My major research topics are multi-target track initiation, multi-target tracking and signal processing. I have some experience in <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/visiting-advisors/research-fellow.html">Research Projects</a> at the image fusion group of advanced avionics and intelligent information laboratory. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and deep learning.
