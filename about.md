I'm a third year undergraduate student from CHINA with a main focus on information and control. From 2021, I studied for the masterâ€™s degree in the <a href="https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/En">School of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>, <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> (SJTU). My major research topics are multi-target track initiation, multi-target tracking and signal processing. I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/1025"> Prof. Xiao</a> to involve many <a href="https://zengliuivy.github.io/projects">research projects</a> in the image fusion group of advanced avionics and intelligent information laboratory, including image recognition and software development.
<br>
<br>
Previously, In June 2021, I received the bachelor degree from <a href="https://cae.nuaa.edu.cn/zdh_en/">College of Automation Engineering</a>, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), Nanjing, China. I majored in detection, guidance and control technology. My <a href="https://zengliuivy.github.io/research">research</a> has appeared in academic journals including <i>Signal, Image and Video Processing</i>, the <i>Chinese Optics Letters</i>, and the <i>Aerospace Systems</i>. Outside of Computer & Signal Processing, I like learning about traditional Chinese culture, musical and stage plays.   
<br>
During my research at the school, I received many honors,including School Outstanding Graduate, Outstanding Student Scholarship, National Encouragement Scholarship, Academic Scholarship. Also, as a team member, I won the second prize in the 2nd national information fusion challenge which is an object detection and tracking competition.
