I'm a third year undergraduate student with a main focus on information and control in China. from 2021, I studied for the masterâ€™s degree in the <a href="https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/">School of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>, <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>(SJTU). My major research topics are multi-target track initiation, multi-target tracking and signal processing. I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/1025"> Prof. Gang Xiao</a> and have been involved in many <a href="https://zengliuivy.github.io/tutorials">research projects</a> in the image fusion group of advanced avionics and intelligent information laboratory, including image recognition and software development.
<br>
Previously, In June 2021, received the bachelor degree from <a href="https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/">Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>(NUAA), Nanjing, China. And I majored in detection, guidance and control technology. My <a href="https://zengliuivy.github.io/research">research</a> has appeared in academic journals including <i>Signal, Image and Video Processing</i>, the <i>Chinese Optics Letters</i>, and the <i>Aerospace Systems</i>. Outside of Computer & Signal Processing, I like learning about traditional Chinese culture, music and the Japanese language.   
<br>
During my research at the school, I received many honors,including school outstanding graduate, outstanding student scholarship, national encouragement scholarship, academic scholarship. Also, as a team member, I won the second prize in the 2nd national information fusion challenge which is an object detection and tracking competition.
