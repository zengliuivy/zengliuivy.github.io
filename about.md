I am an engineering master's student with a main focus on information and control in China. Previously, from 2021, I studied for the masterâ€™s degree in the <a href="https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/">School of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>, <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>(SJTU). My major research topics are multi-target track initiation, multi-target tracking and signal processing. And I have been involved in many research projects in the image fusion group of advanced avionics and intelligent information laboratory, including image recognition and software development. In June 2021, received the bachelor degree from <a href="hhttps://www.nuaa.edu.cn/">Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>(NUAA), Nanjing, China. And I majored in detection, guidance and control technology. Outside of Computer & Signal Processing, I like learning about traditional Chinese culture and the Japanese language.
